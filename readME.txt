This is a brief explanation and summary of my assignment. 

There are 4 parts to the project- 

1. The Code Review: 
- I have done the alternate code review and it can be found in the folder as a file named review.pdf

2. The Code: 
- I've built a website that expresses my interests- specifically in music and sports.
- I have created 3 new webpages- index.html (Main/Homepage), music.html & sports.html 
- Each page has been styled using a stylesheet named styles.css
- All of the images that were used have been stored in the Images folder.
- An audio file that was used can be found in the folder named Audio.
- For each of the three webpages, I've added a header that contains the nav bar that helps shift between pages in the website along with the header of each page.
- In the body of the pages, I've added the content in sections. 
- The footer of the pages have been styled using flex commands. It also contains links in the form of image icons that take the user to different websites depending on the page (for example, in the homepage, clicking the gmail icon opens up the mail application ready to create and send a mail to my address). The icons are in the form of an ordered list.

Main Contents-
a) index.html
- There is a navigation bar that helps the user shift through the webpages easily.
- In the body, I add a picture of myself (as it is a website about my interests) and some text welcoming the user to the website
- Below this, I've added a form that takes the input of the users name and their interests
- In the footer, there are icons that take the user to write a mail to me and another taking them to my linkedin profile
b) music.html
- There is a navigation bar that helps the user shift through the webpages easily
- In the body, There is a picture of a singer that was alligned correctly using grid commands with some text discussing him
- Additionally, I've added a URL that takes the user to the singer's wikipedia page and I've also implemented an audio file in the page complete with controls
- In the footer, there is an icon present that takes the user to the artist's spotify profile 
c) sports.html
- There is a navigation bar that helps the user shift through the webpages easily
- In the body, I discuss my favourite football team. The page contains text, an image and a table about the team (all which have been styled). I've also added a styled unordered list about my current favourite players
- In the footer, there is an icon present that takes the user to a page where they can view the current standing and latest fixtures of the team

Note: 
- All three pages have been adequately styled using styles.css
- There are multiple classes that have been defined in the html code that get utilized in parts by the css stylesheet
- The images used in this assignment have all been modified using styles.css as well
